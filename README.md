# Edward Papers

This repository is for sharing Edward content, including papers, talks, and posters. It is meant to make it easier to reuse and improve any presented materials.

These resources are not restricted to developers: if you have presented anything about Edward, please contribute by including your resources here. We all benefit by building off each other.

Recorded talks can be found at http://edwardlib.org/tutorials/.
