Title:
Edward: A library for probabilistic modeling, inference, and criticism

Abstract:
Probabilistic modeling is a powerful approach for analyzing empirical
information. In this talk, I will provide an overview of Edward, a
software library for probabilistic modeling. Formally, Edward is a
probabilistic programming system built on computational graphs,
supporting compositions of both models and inference for flexible
experimentation. For example, Edward makes it easy to fit the same
model using a variety of composable inferences, ranging from point
estimation, to variational inference, to MCMC. Edward is also
integrated into TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over
existing probabilistic systems. As examples, I will show how Edward
can be leveraged for expanding the frontier of variational inference
and deep generative models.
