Title:
Deep Probabilistic Programming

Abstract:
Probabilistic modeling is a powerful approach for analyzing empirical
information, spanning advances in science as well as perception-based
and cognitive tasks in artificial intelligence. In this talk, I will
provide both an overview of and the most recent advances in Edward, a
probabilistic programming system built on computational graphs.
Edward supports compositions of both models and inference for flexible
experimentation, ranging from a variety of composable modeling blocks
such as neural networks, graphical models, and Bayesian parameterics;
and a variety of composable inferences such as point estimation,
variational inference, and MCMC. In particular I will show how Edward
can be applied for expanding the frontier of deep generative models
and variational inference.
