Title:
Probabilistic Programming with GPs

Abstract:
Probabilistic modeling is a powerful approach for analyzing empirical
information. In this talk, I will provide an overview of Edward, a
software library for probabilistic modeling. Formally, Edward is a
probabilistic programming system built on computational graphs,
supporting compositions of both models and inference for flexible
experimentation. Edward is also integrated into TensorFlow, enabling
large-scale experiments on multi-GPU, multi-machine environments. In
particular, I will show how to apply Gaussian processes in Edward for
two purposes: to build deep probabilistic models for representation
learning and to build flexible variational approximations for accurate
Bayesian inference.
